              Hi, I'm Steve. I like to write code.
            </p>
            <p>
              I started out in technology in the late 1990s as a computer technician and network support engineer. I enjoyed the work,
              and for the most part still do whenever it comes up, but I soon realized that I wanted to get into software
              development. So I started studying
              programming and began writing code. The early days were desktop applications written mostly in Visual Basic before
              moving on to the web with the early versions of ColdFusion.
            </p>
            <p>
              After realizing I wanted to write software for a living I decided to go
              back to school to study computer science. At that time I was a 100% self-taught developer and felt
              that a formal education would help me in some areas where my self-education may be lacking. I completed a Master's degree
              computer science in 2007.
            </p>
            <p>
              These days I'm focusing on JavaScript platforms with Node.js and React but I'm always willing and eager to learn new stacks.
              I love web development and enjoy working on all layers of the web application stack. I'm looking for new and interesting work
              and hope to join a team of talented engineers and do cool stuff. If you or your team needs some help or are
              looking for a new team member and think I may be a good fit, I'd love to talk about it.
            </p>
