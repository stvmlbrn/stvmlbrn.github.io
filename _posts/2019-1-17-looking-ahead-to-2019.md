I like to start each year with a general roadmap of things I would like to improve, learn, or at least gain some more exposure to. In that spirit, here is what is on my list for 2019.

**Docker** - I've been working with Docker a lot over the last few months, but I still I have much to learn. I may be the last person in the world to adopt Docker as part of my toolset, but just in case I'm not I plan on putting together a series of posts about how I use Docker as part of my Node development setup.

**GraphQL** - I think I already have a use-case for GraphQL so this one is pretty high on my list. And let's face it, Facebook's tools have been great.

**VS Code Shortcuts** - Despite using VS Code for a while I still come across features and shortcuts that I didn't know existed. Just this week I learned about `âŒ˜+SHIFT+L` to select all occurances of the current selection (with multiple cursors). Awesome! My plan is to try to incorporate one new keyboard shortcut every week until I know all the ones that are useful to my workflow. I have this [VS Code cheat sheet](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf) sitting on my desk for quick reference.

**Gatsby** - Put this on the _everyone it talking about it so I better take a look_ list. Gatsby sounds cool and people seem to love it, but I'm not sure I have a direct use case for it yet. I suppose the most obvious possibility is to convert this blog, but I've been pretty happy so far with Jekyll so that's not a pressing issue. Still, I'm going to play around with it and at least have a working knowledge of it.

**New React Features** - Sometimes its hard to keep up. I haven't played around much with the Context API (mostly because I've been living in Redux land), and I haven't writting a single React Hook. Now that hooks are officially a part of the React roadmap it's time I give them my full attention. And I'm sure the Context API can simplify code where Redux is overkill, so I'm going to focus there too.

**CSS Grid** - CSS is black magic. I need to learn more of its secrets.

**Serverless Architecture** - I recently saw a presentation at a local developer meetup that has really piqued my interest in serverless architecture. I'm really looking forward to this one.

_Phew!_ That's quite a list. Time to get to work.

If you have any good resources for any of these topics - especially if they are outside of the official docs or other mainstream channels - leave them in the comments or [hit me up on twitter](https://www.twitter.com/stvmlbrn).
